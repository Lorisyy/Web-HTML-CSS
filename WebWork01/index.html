            Lemon Pie<br><br>
            The world is full of gladness,<br>
            There are joys of many kinds,<br>
            There's a cure for every sadness,<br>
            That each troubled mortal finds.<br>
            And my little cares grow lighter<br>
            And I cease to fret and sigh,<br>
            And my eyes with joy grow brighter<br>
            When she makes a lemon pie.<br>
            <br>

            When the bronze is on the filling<br>
            That's one mass of shining gold,<br>
            And its molten joy is spilling<br>
            On the plate, my heart grows bold<br>
            And the kids and I in chorus<br>
            Raise one glad exultant cry<br>
            And we cheer the treat before us<br>
            Which is Grandma's lemon pie.<br>
            <br>

            Then the little troubles vanish,<br>
            And the sorrows disappear,<br>
            Then we find the grit to banish<br>
            All the cares that hovered near,<br>
            And we smack our lips in pleasure<br>
            O'er a joy no coin can buy,<br>
            And we down the golden treasure<br>
            Which is known as lemon pie. <br>
